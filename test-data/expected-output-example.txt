This is a test file for cross-account EventBridge processing.

Timestamp: 2025-01-18T10:00:00Z
Test ID: manual-test-001

This file should trigger:
1. S3 Object Created event in Core Account
2. EventBridge rule in Core Account
3. Cross-account event delivery to RPS Account
4. EventBridge rule in RPS Account
5. SQS message in RPS Account
6. Lambda processing in RPS Account
7. Processed output written back to Core Account S3

If you can read this in the output/ prefix with processing metadata,
the entire cross-account flow is working correctly!
